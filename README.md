### Titanic Survivor Prediction Overview
- Created: A model that predicts which passengers survived the sinking Titanic
- Purpose: To practice data science in Python and showcase the capabilities of various predictive modeling techniques
- - Note: As the outcome occurred in the distant past, there is little purpose beyond the academic.
- Performance: Overall Accuracy of survival (1 - survived | 0 - not-survived) was roughly over 77%
- Best Model: Soft Voting Classifier Enesemble of all trained (non-baseline) models
- Data: Train and Test data set provided by Kaggle
- Features: All features within the data set were extrapolated form the Titanics official passenger register
