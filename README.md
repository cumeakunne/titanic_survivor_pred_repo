### Titanic Survivor Prediction Overview
- Created: A model that predicts which passengers survived the sinking Titanic
- Purpose: To practice data science in Python and showcase the capabilities of various predictive modeling techniques
- - Note: As the outcome occurred in the distant past, there is little purpose beyond the academic.
- Performance: Overall Accuracy of survival (1 - survived | 0 - not-survived) was roughly over 77%
- Best Model: Soft Voting Classifier Enesemble of all trained (non-baseline) models
- Data: Train and Test data set provided by Kaggle
- Features: All features within the data set were extrapolated form the Titanics official passenger register

### Resources Used

### Data Collection
- Downloaded train.csv, test.csv, and gender_submission.csv (Note: gender_submission.csv was sample submisison set for use in submitting to the competition on Kaggle.com)
- The following serves as Data Dictionary for train.csv and test.csv (minus the 'survival' column)

Variable Notes
1. pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
-1st = Upper
-2nd = Middle
-3rd = Lower

2. sibsp: The dataset defines family relations the following way...
- sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
- spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

3. parch: The dataset defines family relations in the following way...
- Parent = mother, father
- Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson (Note: Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.)

4. Age: Age is fractional if less than 1.
